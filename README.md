# Scraping Cryptocurrency Historical Data Snapshot Using python
[Web Scraping](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-web-scraping-and-how-to-use-it/) is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications.

## Description
[CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) is the world's most-referenced price-tracking website for cryptoassets in the rapidly growing cryptocurrency space. Its mission is to make crypto discoverable and efficient globally by empowering retail users with unbiased, high quality and accurate information for drawing their own informed conclusions. 
For example, [Historical Snapshots](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/) contains the entire data in weekly format of the cryptocurrencies till present date.


## Getting Started

### Installing

* We need to install requests, beautifulsoup4, selenium, pandas libraries, webdriver-manager.


### Executing program

* To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up Python, download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the Conda distribution of Python. Click the Run button at the top of this page, select the Run Locally option, and follow the instructions.
>Jupyter Notebooks: This tutorial is a Jupyter notebook - a document made of cells. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc., instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the "Kernel > Restart & Clear Output" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.
